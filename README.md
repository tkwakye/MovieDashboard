# Movie Ratings Dashboard


## Dashboard Description:
### The purpose of this dashboard is to visualize the distribution and trend of how people rate movies throught the years and within different genres. The ratings are coming from more recent years so it shows how people currently view movies that are older. I enjoy movies and other viewers take on them, so in constructing this dashboard I thought to myself what statistical information would I like to see visualized. 

## Dashboard Building Process:
### This process included finding and cleaning an appropriate data set that I could use to get movie details from. Then I had to design a layout of how I wanted my dashboard to look and what aspects I wanted to incorporate in it. Then I would proceed to visualize the desired data using differnt graphs and a data table. Lastly I had to figure out how to make the dashboard more interactive to work towards the purpose of the dashboard as I have leanerd just how much interactivity can positivly contribute to user experience.


## Strengths and Learning Experiences: 
### I am able to learn different ways to utilize Dash components in an effective manner. I am also able to conceptulize how the different components of the application can be used to contribute to interactivity. I am currently learing how to expand my knowledgee in UI/UX to be more visually appealing.
